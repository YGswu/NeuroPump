Please watch the ACM MM'25 MPV in our [project-page][4] for a quick introduction of our work.

## Introduction

JAX's implementation of NeuroPump ([paper][1]). Based on Mip-NeRF 360 ([github][3]).

## Prerequisites

* JAX 0.3.23 compatible GPU with CUDA 11.8
* Conda (Python 3.9)
* jax 0.3.23
* jaxlib 0.3.22+cuda11.cudnn82
* torch 2.1.2+cu118
* torchvision 0.16.2+cu118
* Other packages are listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).

## Usage

#### Reproduce paper results

1. Create a new conda environment:
   ```
   conda create --n pump python=3.9
   conda activate pump
   ```
2. Clone this repo:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YGswu/NeuroPump
   cd NeuroPump
   ```
3. Install required packages by typing
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Download NeuroPump [benchmark dataset (~ 800M)][1] and extract to `data/`
5. Train NeuroPump
   ```
   bash ./scripts/train_neuropump.sh
   ```
6. Test NeuroPump
   Render results:
   ```
   bash ./scripts/render_neuropump.sh
   ```
   Then, find results in your ckpt folder.
7. Render with new optic parameters. We provide 3 kinds of optic parameters: 
   ```
   bash ./scripts/render_neuropump_extension_change_s.sh
   bash ./scripts/render_neuropump_extension_change_refraction_index.sh
   bash ./scripts/render_neuropump_extension_change_background_light.sh
   ```
8. Calculate metrics. We also provide metrics calculation python file. Set right folder name before running.
   ```
   python ./img_process/estimate.py
   ```
